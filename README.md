# Python Programming
Programming is the act of creating computational instructions for a computer to execute. Each language acts as a framework for programmers to constructs their ideas. Programs must be readable, that is, they **must** first be written for humans to understand and then computers to execute. This rule is highly important in collaborative environments.

In simple terms, programming is all about problem solving and there are mechanisms that aid programmers in constructing their ideas:
- __Primitive expressions and statement__ : the simple building blocks the language provides;
- __Means of combination__ : the process in which compound elements are created using simpler ones;
- __Means of abstraction__ : Compound elements can be manipulated.

Programming languages can be defined as formal languages in which strict syntactic rules must be followed. Main elements of programming:
- __Functions__ : rules for manipulating data; can be built-in like *print()* or defined by the programmer;
- __Data__ : the things that programmers want to manipulate.

## About Python
Python is a translated language created by **Guido van Rossum** as a hobby in 1989. The language was developed to be simple and powerful giving Pythonistas a fun language to use. Python is highly used in fields such as Data Science and Analytics, Bio-technology, and AI, although it is powerful and versatile enough to be used in numerous fields including Web Development.

### Reserved Keywords
Reserved keywords are words that cannot be used as variables because Python use them for specific scenarios. There are 32 reserved words in Python as listed in the table:
