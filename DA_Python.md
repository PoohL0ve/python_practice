# Main Libraries and Packages for Data Analytics and Data Science
Python is a great programming language for Data Analytics and Data Science as it provides a number of free and open source libraries.

## Numpy
Numerical Python (Numpyy) is a package for fast scientific computation that revolves around arrays. The main array type is the *ndarray* that stores homogenous (same) data types. They objects provides fast and efficient computations.
- Numpy arrays are of fixed size at creation and changing the size will delete the original array
- Linear algebra operations, Fourier transform, and random number generation
- Provides a C API to allow C, C++, and Python extensions to access Numpy's DS and computatinal facilities

In DA it allows data to be passed to other Python libraries.

## Pandas
Pandas is used for creating and manipulating data that is stored in a structured form (tabular format)

## Scipy
A collection of packages for scientific computing:
- scipy.stats: Continuous and Discrete Probability, descriptive analysis, and statistical testing
- scipy.linalg: Linear algebra and matrix operations
- scipy.integrate: Numerical integration routines and differential equations

## Scikit-Learn
Used for machine learning in Python

## Matplotlib and Seaborn
Provides the tools for data visualisation.
